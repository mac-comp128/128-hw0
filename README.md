Comp 128 - Homework #0
===

# Overview

The goal of this homework is to make sure that your development environment is setup correctly and that you can submit an
 assignment. You will correct a simple class that has one method.  Given an array of integers, the method returns a new array containing
  the subset of integers that are larger than all integers to their right in the original array. The other elements should be set to zero. If duplicate values exist, a number is not larger than itself.
  
For example, if the method is passed the array {13, 13, 3, 8, 5, 4, 7} it should return a new array of {0, 13, 0, 8, 0, 0, 7}.


### Run the test and write more

1. Run the test. Click on the Test tab in VS Code and run all the tests is the ArrayOrderingTest class. 
2. VS Code will run the test, but it will fail.
3. The existing test is pretty simple, it just tests whether you have modified our starting code. Write a few more tests thinking carefully about potential edge cases in the input array.

### Complete the Algorithm.

1. Open ArrayOrdering.java
2. Fix the line marked "TODO" in ArrayOrdering.java.
3. Rerun the unit tests. Look for a pass next to each test.
4. If (unit tests do not pass) goto step 2.

### Update the Readme

1. Open README.md
2. Scroll to the 'Put your readme updates here' section at the bottom.
3. Add your name.
4. List the big-o of the algorithm you have written, and a brief sentence or two justifying it.

*Note: For this assignment we do not care that you have an optimal solution in terms of time or space, just that it performs correctly
and that the big-o value you list matches the algorithm that you wrote.*

### Submit your assignment.
1. Follow the instructions on the [homework proceedures](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15K351UckNsPs0C9sO4z48xY_cb1vvamA6UymPG260UU/edit?usp=sharing) to commit and push your work to github.
2. Proclaim victory!  You've finished your first 128 homework assignment!
